/**
 * ATOMS
 * Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form
 * label, an input or a button.

 * MOLECULES
 * Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules

/**
 * ORGANISMS
 * Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.

/**
 * TEMPLATES
 * At the template stage, we break our chemistry analogy to get into language that makes more sense to our clients and
 * our final output. Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages. Itâ€™s here where
 * we start to see the design coming together and start seeing things like layout in action.

/**
 * PAGES
 * Pages are specific instances of templates. Here, placeholder content is replaced with real representative content to
